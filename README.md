# onepiece-database
Get the One Piece characters info with one click from ONE PIECE WIKI

Which doesn't work :) just wait

## Requirements
* PyQt5
* pandas

## Problems
* DATA IS NOT FULLY LOADED for some stupid reasons until i move the scroll to the bottom
* Don't even support vertical header except for useless index(in QSqlTableWidget at least) or frozen column which are REALLY vital feature for any database application, so i will do the job with React & Electron instead of good old Qt. I'm not even good at them but my friend suggests that this should be piece of cake with using them, so i gladly ditch this project :)
