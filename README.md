# onepiece-database
Get the One Piece characters info with one click from ONE PIECE WIKI

Which doesn't work :) just wait

## Requirements
* PyQt5
* pandas

## Problems
* Data is not fully loaded for some reasons UNTIL i move the scroll to the bottom
* Don't even support vertical header or frozen column which are REALLY vital feature for any database application, so i will do the job with React & Electron instead of good old Qt.
